Smart Solar Panel with AI Tracking
Overview
This project is a Smart Solar Panel system that uses Computer Vision and AI to autonomously track the sun's position for maximum energy efficiency. It was developed as my Graduation Project at Suez Canal University and received an Excellent grade.

Features
* AI-Based Tracking: Uses YOLO/Computer Vision models to detect the sun's position. * Hardware Integration: Full integration between Python scripts and hardware controllers. * Autonomous Operation: Adjusts panel orientation in real-time based on visual feedback.

Technologies Used
* Languages: Python (AI Logic), C++ (Hardware Control).
* 
AI Frameworks: TensorFlow/Keras or YOLO.

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib.
